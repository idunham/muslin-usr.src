muslin build scripts


These scripts aim to provide a /usr/src style build environment for setting up
a musl-based, FHS/LSB filesystem conformant Linux distribution.
It is anticipated, but not required, that these scripts will be installed in
/usr/src themselves.

The primary intent is to provide a build environment for muslin.
muslin will use Linux for the kernel, musl for libc, and the FHS for 
filesystem layout.  It aims to be lightweight, much like the namesake fabric.
Documentation will be primarily in the form of manpages.

muslin is designed with the intent of conforming to SUS4, while being 
compatible with older hardware.
